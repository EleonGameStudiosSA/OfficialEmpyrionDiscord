2. Make the changes you want to make and commit this to the created fork
3. Create a pull request to the main repro

## Info

- Follow the YAML Structure. So no tabs are allowed
- Do not modify the file formating
- Do not modify the Intro key and its value
- Discord uses Markdown formatting

You are able to create new keys with new info. If you do so be sure to mention this info in your pull-request so the menu can be updated with this.

### Note: 
> Updated entries will be visible in the FAQ Menu when the pull request is approved and merged.  
For new entries the code needs to be changed.
