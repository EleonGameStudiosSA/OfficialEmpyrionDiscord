# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/empyrion) instead of opening an issue – you will get redirected there anyway.**

## Setup

1. Create a fork
	<p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EleonGameStudiosSA/OfficialEmpyrionDiscord/main/.github/Assets/CreateFork.png" width="250" alt="FAQ Menu"/></a>
    </p>
2. Make the changes you want to make and commit this to the created fork
3. Create a pull request to the main repro

## Info

- Follow the YAML Structure. So no tabs are allowed
- Do not modify the file formating
- Do not modify the Intro key and its value
- Discord uses Markdown formatting

You are able to create new keys with new info. If you do so be sure to mention this info in your pull-request so the menu can be updated with this.

### Note: Updated entries will be visible in the FAQ Menu when the pull request is approved and merged. For new entries the code needs to be changed
